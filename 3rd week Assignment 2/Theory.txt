Screen Reader 
Voice recognition software
Keyboard alternatives 

4. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.

Screen Reader : A screen reader is a software that reads out loud the content of a web page to individuals
who are visually impaired. 9t can also interpret and communicate information about graphics, multimedia,
and other elements on the page.

Voice recognition software : Voice recognition software enables users to navigate web pages and input
text using voice commands. This technology is particularly useful for individuals with mobility impairments
or those who have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse.

Keyboard alternatives : keyboard alternatives such as sip-and-puff devices, head-tracking devices, and
eye-tracking devices allow individuals with physical disabilities to navigate and interact with web pages
without the use of a traditional keyboard or mouse.
