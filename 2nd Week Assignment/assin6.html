        <li style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" > Procedural programming languages
        </li>
        <p>A procedural language follows a sequence of statements or commands in order to achieve a desired output. Each
            series of steps is called a procedure, and a program written in one of these languages will have one or more
            procedures within it</p>
        <li style="background-color: black; color: aliceblue;">Functional programming languages </li>
        <p>Rather than focusing on the execution of statements, functional languages focus on the output of mathematical
            functions and evaluations. Each function–a reusable module of code–performs a specific task and returns a
            result.</p>
     
        <li style="background-color: black;color: aliceblue;">Object-oriented programming languages </li>
        <p>This type of language treats a program as a group of objects composed of data and program elements, known as
            attributes and methods. Objects can be reused within a program or in other programs. </p>
   
        <li style="background-color: black;color: aliceblue;">Scripting languages</li>
        <p>Programmers use scripting languages to automate repetitive tasks, manage dynamic web content, or support
            processes in larger applications.</p>
